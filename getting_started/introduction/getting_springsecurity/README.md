#　1.4 获取 Spring Security
---

You can get hold of Spring Security in several ways. You can download a packaged distribution from the main Spring Security page, download individual jars from the Maven Central repository (or a Spring Maven repository for snapshot and milestone releases) or, alternatively, you can build the project from source yourself.

你可以通过多种方式获取SpringSecurity。可以在Spring Security官方网站下载发布的jar包，也可以在maven中央仓库获取单独jar包，亦或可以自己通过源码编译获取。
